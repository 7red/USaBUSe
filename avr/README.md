Atmega32u4 firmware for the Universal Serial aBuse project
==========================================================

This repository contains the firmware for the Atmega32u4 chip on the USB board.

Program it using the flash_avr wrapper, or generally using avrdude.

It depends on the excellent LUFA library, by Dean Camera, and was built against version 0626ac1f63cc18faf1649ae05a363dae564ab8d2 from the git repo at https://github.com/abcminiuser/lufa

The makefiles expect to find the lufa tree at ../lufa
